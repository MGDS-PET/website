Abstract
--------------------------------------------------
Transmedia gaming refers to gaming that works between various electronic platforms and devices. In tween this research we describe interactions between a gaming system that exist simultaneously on on-line, computer application, TV and wearable devices. Narratives can migrate seamlessly between these various platforms. This paper discussed aspects of this migration process as it relates to narratives and their structures.
