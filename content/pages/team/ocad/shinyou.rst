Shin-you is a materials artist and designer who specializes in metalsmithing and body adornment. He is in the process of finishing an undergraduate degree within OCAD Universityâ€™s Jewellery/Metalsmithing program. 

From his time in this program as well as various self-exploratory experiments, Shin-you has gathered a repertoire of techniques and materials non-traditional to jewellery. He enjoys material discovery and unifies complex technique with sculptural materials within his body adornments. Often his designs are complex in concept as well as execution seeking to incorporate poetic messages. The focus of his practice is theatrical body adornments that create a dialogue of object, viewer and wearer through intricate design and imaginative ideas.
