	Overall design and research process that starts with questions.
	

The research process is one in which large numbers of prototypes are rapidly created and tested. Creation of prototypes is motivated by research questions. These are detailed within the component and device documentation. Prototypes go through many iterations. With each new iteration new questions are formulated and ideas solidified. The design process creates not only artifacts with material properties but also intellectual assets such as ideas, hypotheses and questions. These investigations eventually lead to a wrist-wearable device that uses an etched leather band, with a 3D watch-like housing that holds electronic components.
