	Overall design and research process that starts with questions.
	

The research process followed was one in which prototypes were rapidly created and tested. Creation of prototypes was motivated by research questions, which are detailed within the component and device documentation. 

Prototypes went through many iterations. With each new iteration new questions were formulated and ideas solidified. The design process created not only artifacts with material properties but also intellectual assets such as ideas, hypotheses and questions.

These investigations eventually led to a wrist-wearable device that uses an etched leather band, with a 3D watch-like component that houses electronic components.
