Questions 
--------------------------------------------------

Questions: NSERC/ISTP Grant
..................................................


#. According to the grant, what are the main research challenges in this project?
	- building wearable game technologies
	- developing game biometric interfaces
	- creating a multi-platform game distribution system

#. What is Time Tremors (TT) and how does to relate to this current research?
	- TT is an internationally-financed transmedia game designed and implemented by Xenophile Media, Toronto
	- TT is collection game in which players (tweens aged 7-12) search for objects from history

#. How is TT a 'transmedia' game?
	- it works works across various media: online, TV, mobile and physical museums
	- it connects narratives created for different platforms to flow seamlessly together
	- it encourages consumption of narratives to be 'device-agnostic' while still maintaining an integrated style of story-telling

#. How is the TT app used by visitors to the Art Gallery of Ontario?
	- Creates theme-based tours and narratives that showcase the AGO collection
	- Encourages young visitors to find and discover details and fragments from the AGO collection and integrates these fragments into a unified narrative
	- Encourages visitors to imagine narratives that are informed by museum artifacts
	- Encourage visitors to notice interesting details of artifacts that they may easily miss during a visit

#. How do you fully integrate the human body into transmedia gameplay through application of biometric sensors?
	- Sense biometric data, such as wearer's heart rate and galvanic skin response, as they participate in games
	- Create narrative points of interest, tension and release in the gameplay that correspond to anticipated bodily reactions in the player
	- Direct narrative flow of the gameplay via reactions from the player as measured by the biometric sensors


Design of device
..................................................


#. What are the basic use cases for a transmedia mobile device with biometric sensors?
	- Register user's position and orientation
	- Register hand and arm movements
	- Record user's heart rate and changes to their heart rate
	- Record galvanic skin response
	- Provide a marker for current position in the smartphone game narrative

#. What are suitable materials for a device of this type?
