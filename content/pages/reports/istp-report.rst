E) Continuation of R&D
--------------------------------------------------

.. An indication as to whether or how the project team will continue to work after the project i.e., are the Participants continuing their relationship, are they continuing to invest in the R&D with their own funding, etc.*

The OCADU Team will be continuing their work on the MGDS-PET project until August of 2015 with the continued support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). The vibrotactile research was included as a collaborating project with an application by researchers at OCADU to the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI). The Brazilian partnership with OCADU will continue to develop as hardware, form, material, firmware, and functionality continually improve through co-design and user feedback.
