c. R&D Description
--------------------------------------------------

*Specific details of the project’s direction and goals. A detailed description of the R&D domain and an overall evaluation of the R&D in relation to other R&D being done in the same domain.*

Project's Direction and Goals
..................................................

The project began with exploring ways to augment an existing museum exploration application based on Xenophile's transmedia series *Times Tremors*. This app encouraged young visitor to the Art Gallery of Ontario to explore the collection in a more detailed fashion, and in a way that connects recurring these within the collection.  

In this paper we explore the design, layout and configuration of wrist-wearable, haptic gaming interfaces,
which involve visual and vibrotactile spatial and temporal patterns. Our goal is to determine overall layouts and
spatial and temporal resolutions on the wrist suitable for interactive tactile stimuli. Our approach is to First explore
the simplest of configurative patterns that are intended to encircle the wrist, and then study their affordances. We
describe various informal user studies we have employed to explore and test issues that arose.

Impacts
--------------------------------------------------

*Provide a description of any public good that may have resulted from the project. For example, related to public health and safety, the environment, national codes and standards. Describe any wealth creation such as increased employment, sales, exports and an increase in national or international competitiveness. Such information is useful in helping to establish ISTP Canada’s effectiveness at delivering is programs to its funders.*

*In addition, as part of the Program performance measurement strategy, ultimate recipients are asked to specifically describe the following indicators, based on the results achieved and/or anticipated from the ISTP funded project:*

#. the types of knowledge and understanding acquire 
#. the degree to which ultimate recipients are able to enhance future R&D plans and activities, and their ability to make more informed strategic decisions 
#. the types of licensing/commercialization agreements concluded 
#. the number, value, and type of products and services commercialized demonstrating the project overall economic value 
#. the number, value, and type of products and services commercialized demonstrating the project overall economic value
