Introduction
-----------------

The Infinity Band is a sci-fi wearable toy designed to entertain children whilst encouraging them to stay active and fit. 

Worn on the wrist, the band enables children to play a magical collection game which also encourages them to engage in a variety of active movements from low to high intensity. [both types of exercise are recommended for optimum health and wellbeing benefits - provide research]. 

Players are able to compete with other players, trade their finds and explore an exciting story-world opened up by their collection via an accompanying smart phone app.


The Story
-------------

The Infinity Band is a 'future artifact' created by the Time Keepers to locate and collect past and future Time Treasures. These objects have been, or will be, instrumental in shaping the path of history. The Infinity Band was stolen from the Time Vault of the Time Agents in 3015, and smuggled back to the present day once it became apparent that an evil force known as Bugly, was intent on the complete destruction to the very fabric of time and space. 

[this shortened version of the back story needs more work]


Use Cases and Functions
-------------------------------

The Infinity Band works by translating kinetic energy into Time Energy when activated in the correct way. It enables the wearer to reach through time and grab a Time Treasure from the future or past.


Generating Time Energy and Discovery
........................................

The Infinity Band generates Time Energy through persistent motion. This Time Energy is stored in a circular band that surrounds the centerpiece of the device. The more walking, running or otherexercise a child does the quicker their time energy will fill up. It will take approximately 90 minutes of activity to fill up the Time Energy from empty.

The centre piece of the device will light up depending on the players progress. This could be split into three colours, bronze, sliver and gold. This indicates milestones in progress, or levels of achievement. Time wise this could be split into 40, 60 and 90 minutes of moderate movement. When each level is reached, the device will vibrate. Once for 40 minutes, twice for 60 minutes, and three times for 90 minutes.

Activity detection uses a combination of a heart rate monitor and pedometer to ensure that the player has is being active enough and is not just shaking the device with their wrist. The level of achievement will dictate the variety of the the treasure to be collected.

or

The player must reach gold to unlock a Time Treasure. If they have accomplished bronze or silver, then they will be awarded with power ups to use in the Time Tremors Infinity Game.


Retrieving a Treasure
........................................

Treasures are awarded at the beginning of each day following the day of activity. This way, kids will look forward to opening the app with anticipation to discover what they have won. Once the treasure has been awarded, they receive encouragement for the activity for the day ahead. By connecting the device to the Infinity Band App, the player is able to view all of their collection including the Time Treasures they have just discovered, which will animate into the player’s collection board. By touching any of these treasures they are able to view a 3d explorable version of the Time Treasure, read about its back-story or trade the Time Treasure, and check leaders boards.


Leader Boards
........................................

Leaders Boards exist for the player’s global collection as well as for each Mission they have undertaken. They are crucial for getting keeping a sense of competition across. Would also consider placing some fictional characters in the leader boards, so competing again Time Mutants or Bugly her very self to retrieve treasures quicker than she does.


Heart Rate
........................................

There is a small hear shape light on the wrist band. When lit up, the player will receive an increased rate of time energy accumulation that goes above 60% to 70% of of their maximum heart rate, the cardio zone (A formula that appropriately estimates maximum heart rate is subtracting a persons age from 220. Although not exact, this formula works for most people in most conditions, player’s age will need to be acquired via app).

It is at this point and beyond that the player will achieve more health benefits such as fat burning. Trading and Treasure Fusing

Questions
----------------

- Do we not need an indicator for when batteries are dying out?
- Should we have the heart rate light flash if the player is reaching a dangerously high rate?
- App should use the same message methods as TT Infinity.
- Do 2 different scenarios of how core mechanics could work, gold, siliver bronze, treasure only awarded if gold is achieved.
- Think about indication of how basic information can be delivered through the interface such as start of day, end of day.
