Description
--------------------------------------------------

The felt prototype was an exploration of a band that would ideally be made out of leather. Felt allowed for rapid prototyping and easy stitching. The band fully encircles the wrist and uses a double snap closure that can be adjustable, on the underside of the arm. The Arduino is sewn onto the top section using conductive thread and wires. This is covered with a flap of fabric that also secures with a snap closure. This provides access to the Arduino's battery for recharging, as well as being a design feature that allows for visible hardware. 

The top fabric flap has three (Time Crystal) NeoPixels sewn on with conductive thread that is attached to the Arduino underneath via the flap stitching. Two holes have also been included mid way along the flap, so that the newly designed NeoPixel ring/vibrating bead can be snapped onto the lower layer. The snaps are in turn connected to the Arduino. On the underside of the band, flush with the wrist are two GSR sensors, connected with conductive thread to the Arduino. 


Design and Research Questions
--------------------------------------------------

- Can we streamline and simplify the band and incorporate Arduino and wiring?
- How can we position and include the Time crystals into the band design?
- Is there a way to make the hardware visible, without compromising functionality? 
- What is the best way to proceed with vibrating LED beads and NeoPixel rings?

Discussion
--------------------------------------------------

This design was inspired by steampunk aesthetics and the possibilities of having visible hardware. The flap was designed to allow for visibility as well as access to battery and Arduino. The NeoPixels were chosen because of their addressable capabilities, variety of colour options and the versatility they offer because of these features. They are also lighter and smaller than the resin/LED beads, allowing for more of them to be incorporated into a design. 

The NeoPixel ring was included to address some aesthetic considerations regarding the Time Tremors world for which the band was designed. Aesthetically, a round shape was required to reflect the so-called Celestial Atlas. This new approach provided a more diverse range of options regarding incorporation into the band, including possibilities of housing the Arduino on the underside of the wrist, beside the band closure and other orientations. This iteration led to similar explorations in leather and conductive thread.
