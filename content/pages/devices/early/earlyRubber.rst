Description
------------------

These were early devices meant to test ideas for wrist-wearables comprised of vibrating motors and input buttons. These are controlled externally by an Arduino board. Vibrating motors on the band are programmed to play with various patterns and intensities. Composition of patterns using MIDI data is also possible. It is possible to create patterns using music composition techniques and standard musical notation (in an application such as `Lilypond <http://www.lilypond.org/>`_, which exports MIDI data) and thereby programming the Arduino board for the activation of various vibrating motor patterns. 

Use Cases
---------------

- Stop and start the activation of vibrating patterns on the device by button clicking
	- These are the 'quasi-musical' rhythmic patterns created by the vibrating motors.

Components
----------------

- Rubber band (built from recycled conveyor-belt material)
- Vibrating motors (original use )
