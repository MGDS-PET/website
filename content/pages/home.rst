MGDS-PET is the Multi-platform Game Distribution System for Popular and Experimental Technologies. This NSERC and ISTP funded research addresses the challenge of fully integrating the human body into transmedia game play through variable applications of wearable biometric sensors.

MGDS-PET combines biometric sensing with wearable technology integrated into a transmedia game engine. While developed for a specific title, our research attempts to generalize into an affordable product meeting the needs of the transmedia industry, which increasingly aims to provide integrated gaming experiences in platform-agnostic technological environments.
