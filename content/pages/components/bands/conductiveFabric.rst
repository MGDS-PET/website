Description
--------------------------------------------------

This was an investigation into the capabilities of stretch conductive fabric to act as a band and circuit to power resin LED beads. The band consists of two tubular conductive fabric strips with snaps sewn on to connect a series of beads in parallel. A pocket for the Arduino and battery is sewn to one side, which acts as a housing and a support to separate the two strips from each other. Neoprene is added to create a waterproof layer between the skin and Arduino and as a third band between the conductive tubes. 


Design and Research Questions
--------------------------------------------------

- How can we incorporate the Arduino into the band design?
- How can we make a band that will fit snugly to various wrist sizes and can be put on and taken off easily?
- If we used conductive fabric, would any power be lost to modular bead units?


Components
--------------------------------------------------

- Stretchy conductive fabric
- LightBlue Bean Arduino
- Neoprene layer
- Snaps to connect beads

Discussion
--------------------------------------------------

The pocket for the Arduino worked well and was a snug fit. Connection of ports to each conductive tube had been considered a minor detail, so wiring was visible. Once the beads were snapped into place and current was run through the device, it became apparent that there was too much resistance being created by the fabric, as the beads were not fully functional. Conductive thread was run through the tubes and stitched into each snap to enhance the conductivity of the tubes, this helped, but distance from the battery still proved a problem to power all the beads. 

While the conductive fabric seemed like a viable option because it offered flexibility and a one-size-fits-all style for manufacture, it became apparent that we would not be able to make a fully functional prototype using this method.
