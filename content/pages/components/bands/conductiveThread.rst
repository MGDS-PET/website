Description
--------------------------------------------------

Conductive thread investigations took the form of multiple strands that used various techniques such as knotting and knitting to gauge the capability of thread to conduct current to vibrating beads. The lengths of conductive materials were short, and each incorporated one LED or bead to test conductivity. Lengths of knotted or knitted fabrics were attached to each other and the battery using alligator clips or tied together. 


Design and Research Questions
--------------------------------------------------

- Does the vibrating bead lose any power/capability when the circuit is made of conductive thread instead of wiring?
- Can conductive thread be incorporated into a 'friendship' bracelet design, and maintain functionality?
- Would multiple vibrating beads remain fully functional when connected to each other using conductive thread?


Components
--------------------------------------------------

- LEDs or vibrating LED beads
- Conductive thread and yarn
- 3V coin cell battery 

Discussion
--------------------------------------------------

Kitted or knotted circuits, while successful, did not help solve problems related to bead addressability or possibilities of incorporating buttons and switches. Distance from the battery also negatively effected the functionality of the beads. Single pieces worked well, but when connected to each other, distance from the battery diminished the power flow to each bead. It is assumed that the conductive thread created too much resistance for the beads to be effectively powered.
