Description
--------------------------------------------------

This band was a basic exploration of the combination of 3D printed units and braided conductive thread. The aim of this prototype was to troubleshoot some of the difficulties related to including a button and a conductive band. 


Design and Research Questions
--------------------------------------------------

- How can we incorporate a bead and a button into the band?


Components
--------------------------------------------------

- Braided conductive thread
- embroidery thread
- 3D printed units


Discussion
--------------------------------------------------

The 3D printed units were intended to house vibrating motors that would also act as buttons. Snaps would also be accommodated so that a small bead could be attached alongside the motor. 
This prototype did not go past the exploration phase, as a fully 3D printed version was developed instead. The 3D printed variation, while it possessed its own set of challenges, was better suited to designs that would fully encircle the wrist without presenting closure and conduction problems.
