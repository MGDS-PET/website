Description
--------------------------------------------------

This new design direction was instigated by the need to cleanly house all the electronic components and rapidly produce a prototype. It was decided that a round 3D printed casing with arms to allow for an interchangeable band to slide into place would be created. This casing would house an Arduino board, battery, wiring, vibrating motor and a NeoPixel ring and single NeoPixel array would make up the face of the watch-like design. The band would be etched with Time Tremors inspired glyphs and runes to maintain brand identity and tie into the aesthetic of the game.


Design and Research Questions
--------------------------------------------------

- What would the Time Tremors glyphs look like when etched onto leather?
- What would an etched leather band look like when paired with a 3D printed electronics casing? 
- Is it possible to house all the necessary electronic components within one 3D printed housing? 
- Using a watch/band for inspiration, is it possible to build a prototype that does not incorporate a smart band?


Components
--------------------------------------------------

- Laser cut leather band
- 3D printed electronics casing/module
- LightBlue Bean Arduino module
- Rechargeable LiPo battery
- Vibrating motor
- Single NeoPixel LED
- 12 x LED NeoPixel ring


Discussion
--------------------------------------------------

The new 3D printed module did allow for all the components to be housed together, however, it ended up being very bulky and large. This was a problem when considering that it was being designed for children. A slot to recharge the battery via micro USB had been cut into the housing and this would also provide a space for the GSR sensor wires to run to the Arduino. 

The band looked good with the laser etching and cutting and further simplified the design process as it was no longer required for it to be “smart”. The Time Tremors designs were positioned in such a way as to frame the 3D printed unit and echo the shapes made by the “watch” face.

The band and 3D printed unit worked well together and it was decided that another iteration using the same general idea would be developed.  A decision was made to reiterate the design and attempt to remove some of the bulk and cut down some of the size.
