Rubber was an initial material for exploration. Rubber is inexpensive, waterproof, easy to cut and mould and is quite durable. It is hard to the touch however and tends not to be stylistically appropriate for the pre-teen, 'tween' (aged 7-12 years) audience for whom the Mgds-Pet wearable is being designed.
