Description
--------------------------------------------------

The new 3D printed watch-like unit was thinner and flatter than the previous iteration. It was rectangular in shape so that the inner components could lie side-by-side rather than being stacked on top of each other. Holes for accommodating the micro USB and GSR sensor wires were moved to allow the battery to be recharged and to make sure that all components would fit inside the unit. However, this new design answered all other questions relating to space. Recesses were printed on the inside of the casing so that the Arduino and battery unit would not shift and move. 

The arms that accommodated the band were made smaller and shorter, as well as being moved to the underside of the unit to make them more discreet and streamline the appearance. Some recessed sun dial type designs were incorporated into the face to create aesthetic continuity with the band design. 
This 3D printed version adhered to the aesthetics and practical aspects of the project. A more refined version was planned based on the minor readjustments.


Design and Research Questions
--------------------------------------------------

- Is it possible to cut down the bulk of the 3D printed housing and still accommodate all of the necessary components?
- Can the arms that the band slides through be made shorter and more discreet? 
- Is there a way to make sure that the electronic components don't move around inside the unit while it's being worn? 
- Can an aesthetic be incorporated into the 3D printing process to provide some form of bran recognition/aesthetic component onto the face of the unit? 

Components
--------------------------------------------------

- Leather (approx. 1.5mm thick)

Discussion
--------------------------------------------------

Laser cutting is a practical way to cut leather if the leather is not too thick. It has proven to be a precise and economical technique (assuming one has access to a laser cutting machine). It tends to heat the leather, which then might start to smolder or burn as a result. A 'burnt leather' smell tends to remain with the leather for a time. We did not try to cut thicker material, such as belting leather, with this technique.
