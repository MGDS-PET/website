Moulded clay beads were an initial experimental material to create interesting forms that might be translated into other materials, or to serve as moulds. They tend to provide a pre-industrial or 'Mesopotamian' aesthetic, which is interesting and creates beautiful organic textures, but is not particularly appropriate for our target audience.
