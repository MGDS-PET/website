Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for the inexpensive creation of interactive projects. Arduino-based projects typically sense the environment by receiving inputs from sensors and affect their surroundings by controlling lights, motors and other actuators. `Arduino Home <http://www.arduino.cc/>`_
